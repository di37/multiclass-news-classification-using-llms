tech,europe backs digital tv lifestyle how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change  following the launch of an ambitious european project.  in nice last week  the european commission announced its networked & electronic media (nem) initiative. its broad scope stretches from the way media is created  through each of the stages of its distribution  to its playback. the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly  when on the move  at home or at work  no matter who supplies the devices  network  content  or content protection scheme. more than 120 experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia  intel  philips  alcatel  france telecom  thomson and telefonica. it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. but again and again  speakers stated they could not see incompatible  stand-alone solutions working. a long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.  the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach. they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses. the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline  pick out the best  bring them together and identify where the gaps are. where it finds holes  it will develop standards to fill them. what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. this is bound to please  if not surprise  many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management (drm) schemes. currently drm solutions are incompatible  locking certain types of purchased content  making them unplayable on all platforms. with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally  the prize for being the supplier of the world s dominant drm scheme is huge. although entertainment is an obvious first step  it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare  energy efficiency and control of the smart home. the 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years.  simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website  which covers the impact of technology on media,entertainment,tech, tech,output: tech

politics,report attacks defence spending the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects.  a national audit office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by £1.7bn in the past year. it says there is  little evidence  the mod s performance had improved  despite the introduction of a  smart acquisition  policy six years ago. a senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned. the nao s annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach £50bn - 14% higher than originally planned. the total delays amounted to 62 months  with average individual delays rising by three months.  sir john bourn  head of the nao  said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied.  many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase   the report says. the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older  legacy projects   such as the eurofighter. a senior defence official  speaking to the bbc s defence correspondent paul adams  said that although the figures were still not good enough  the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. this year s overspend was significantly less than last year s £3.1bn total  and the defence procurement agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving.  lord bach  minister for defence procurement  said he was  obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown   but insisted that the defence procurement agency had  undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects . the latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months  and  according to our correspondent  contain few new surprises. turning around the defence procurement agency  was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed   he said. our correspondent said it was the same projects  including the joint strike fighter  the nimrod and a400m aircraft and the type 45 destroyer  which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay. but he added some projects  such as the c-17 heavy lift aircraft and successor identification friend or foe (siff)  were showing good performances.,politics,politics, business,output: business

sport,man utd through after exeter test manchester united avoided an fa cup upset by edging past exeter city in their third round replay.  cristiano ronaldo scored the opener  slipping the ball between paul jones  legs after just nine minutes. united wasted a host of chances to make it safe as jones made some great saves  but wayne rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. exeter had chances of their own  sean devine twice volleying wide and andrew taylor forcing tim howard to save. united boss sir alex ferguson was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to paul scholes and ryan as well as ronaldo and rooney. exeter began brightly with devine and steve flack seeing plenty of the ball  but it did not take united long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves a goal down. scholes played a lovely pass in to ronaldo on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of jones to open the scoring.  united sensed a chance to finish the tie as a contest early on and ronaldo blazed over before jones saved well from scholes and then rooney. the visitors  pressure by now was incessant and rooney had another shot blocked while ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. just before the break giggs had a golden chance to double the advantage  but the welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. in stoppage time exeter created their best chance as alex jeannin swung in a cross from the left that devine managed to flick goalwards  but the ball flew wide of howard s goal. the grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and howard had to show safe hands to collect two searching crosses into the united box. rooney looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the st james park mud and jones raced back to gather on the goalline. moments later devine had the chance to make himself a hero  but he could only volley jeannin s brilliant cross wide of howard s goal after being left unmarked six yards out. after rooney had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yards out taylor showed him how it should be done  his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from howard. the home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for devine s low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. the persistent rooney eventually rounded jones with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with middlesbrough in the fourth round.  jones  hiley  sawyer  gaia  jeannin  moxey  taylor (martin 89)  ampadu (afful 69)  clay  flack (edwards 74)  devine. subs not used: rice  todd.  ampadu  clay.  howard  phil neville  gary neville  o shea  fortune  giggs (saha 70)  miller (fletcher 66)  scholes  djemba-djemba (silvestre 80)  ronaldo  rooney. subs not used: ricardo  bellion.  ronaldo 9  rooney 87.  9 033.  p dowd (staffordshire).,sport,sport, sport,output: sport

tech,nintendo ds makes its euro debut nintendo s ds handheld game console has officially gone on sale in europe.  many stores around the uk opened at midnight to let keen gamers get their hands on the device. the two-screen clamshell gadget costs £99 (149 euros) and 15 games are available for it at launch  some featuring well-known characters such as super mario and rayman. the ds spearheads nintendo s attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market.  since going on sale in japan and the us at the end of 2004  nintendo has sold almost 4m ds consoles.  part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the ds can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for nintendo s gameboy advance handheld. games for the ds are expected to cost between £19 and £29. about 130 games for the ds are in development.  as well as having two screens  one of which is controlled by touch  the ds also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless. a  download play  option means ds owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game. other ds owners can also be sent text messages and drawings. nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video. five virgin megastores and 150 game shops were expected to open early on friday morning to let people buy a ds.  we know that customers want it as soon as it s released - and that means the minute  not the day   said robert quinn  game s uk sales director.  but nintendo will only have sole control of europe s handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon sony is expected to release its psp console. although nintendo is aiming for younger players and the psp is more for older gamers  it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers. sony s psp represents a real threat to nintendo because of the huge number of playstation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget. the psp uses small discs for games  can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play. when it goes on sale the psp is likely to cost between £130 and £200.,entertainment,tech, sport,output: tech

politics,tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner  under plans unveiled by the conservatives.  party leader michael howard said the new role would replace  inconspicuous  police authorities. he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing  while labour criticised  extravagant  tory promises on policing.  responding to the plans  the chairman of the police federation of england and wales  which represents rank and file officers  said it was essential operational independence was retained.  jan berry said:  it is a service  not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches.  these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground   she warned. outlining his crime manifesto  mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.  the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  the trouble is  and it s no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are.  mr howard said the authorities were not  providing the local accountability that we want to see  and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.  critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. lord harris  who sits on the executive of association of police authorities  said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.  that is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions   he said.  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and  could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials . mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a  minimum policing guarantee  with their chief constables. a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard s record  saying police numbers had fallen by 1 132 when he was home secretary. he said:  today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them  other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.  the tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an american sheriff. other tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.,politics,politics, politics,output: politics

politics,howard attacks  pay later  budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as  vote now  pay later  spending plans.  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole  mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor s  sweeteners   but these hid tax rises for hard working families  he said. labour s  faltering election campaign  would not be helped by the package of measures  mr howard added.  mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country  but  all about the interests of the labour party   the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging  millions of people in to the net  to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.  we can all see the sweeteners  but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins.   he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  mr brown liked to rattle off  magical balances conjured out of thin air  in a bid to convince people there was no  black hole  in the nation s finances  the tory leader said.  this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers   he said.  you now propose to borrow  over the next six years  no less than £168 billion; so much for prudence.  the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.   mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was £300 less than what the tories were offering  mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets  make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a  clear choice  at the election  either  more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives   he said.  that s the battleground of this election. that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on   he concluded  to loud tory cheering.,politics,politics, politics,output: politics

politics,drink remark  acts as diversion  the first minister s statement that it was okay to get drunk  once in a while  has diverted attention from the real issues  it has been claimed.  jack law  chief executive of alcohol focus scotland  said jack mcconnell s comment was  ill-advised . the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems  mr law said. scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been  obscured  by the remark. mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.  the one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were  a recognition that people will get drunk . mr macdonell  political editor of the scotsman  said:  i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister.  if you come out with something like this  saying that by all means get drunk  then you will be pilloried for it.  however  he added that  perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage .  mr macdonell said:  i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking.  but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. i understand why  but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.  mr law  from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland  believed damage had been done to scotland s fight against binge drinking. he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. mr law added:  i think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland.   we don t want to preach to young people  but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically.  this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.  he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were  off the mark   they were bound to  come back and bite him . he added:  here  mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters.  i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.   the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his  ill-judged comment  and withdraw it immediately. in a furious response  the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. he told ms sturgeon:  it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i  should encourage young people to get drunk .  that is completely untrue. perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position  undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.,politics,politics, politics,output: politics
politics,strike threat over pension plans millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer  warn union leaders.  the cabinet office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system  prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. they believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made.  it is thought the proposed overhaul  due on thursday  could mean pensions could be based on a  career average  salary. for each year served  staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election  which is widely expected next may. in a statement on sunday  the cabinet office said it was reviewing the civil service pension scheme  and hoped to announce proposals soon.  unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes.  public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. people are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive.  to maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme  the government announced in its green paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65.  on monday  tony blair s official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. he said:  what s important is that there s a process going on  it s out for consultation at the moment  let s wait for that process to complete itself.   there is already widespread anger over the chancellor s plans to get rid of more than 100 000 civil servants. now public service unions are united against the plans and the trades union congress is discussing the issue next monday. dave prentis  general secretary of unison  said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal.  members working in the nhs or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses  but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away   he said.  what really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of mps who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in europe  but say they can t afford it for anyone else.  this is a position that unison cannot accept and will oppose. it will lead to conflict between unison and the government  if not this year then next.   mr prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. mark serwotka  from the public and commercial services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. the fire brigades union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. pensions officer paul woolstenholmes said:  the pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from mps and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.,politics,politics," the text would be classified as ""business"" because it discusses issues related to employment, pensions, and labor unions in the context of public service work and government policy.",output: politics
sport,smith keen on home series return scotland manager walter smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the home international series.  such a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the northern irish fa  howard wells  at the next meeting of the four home countries. the english fa has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season. but smith said:  bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that s something that s needed.  the home international series was done away with in 1984  with the traditional scotland-england fixture continuing until 1989. that game is one smith would be delighted to see reinstated.  the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season   he added.  i was in italy for their friendly with russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20 000 fans turned up to watch.  england were criticised for the 0-0 draw against holland - the way scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies.  you have to put a performance on in friendly games. if you don t  they can be de-motivating.  it can be a dangerous road to go down  if players don t apply themselves in the manner they should.  so i would support the return of the home internationals - the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule.,sport,sport, sport,output: sport

tech,savvy searchers fail to spot ads internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated  suggests a report into search habits.  the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. the report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use google  ask jeeves  msn and yahoo when online.  almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less  if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. a significant chunk of net users  36%  carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. for 44% of those questioned  the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find.  search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. according to pew research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine  48% use two or three and a small number  7%  consult more than three sites. tony macklin  spokesman for ask jeeves  said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. a small number  17%  said they wouldn t really miss search engines if they did not exist. the remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. more than two-thirds of those questioned  68%  said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. of those asked  62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. said the pew report:  this finding is ironic  since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results.  commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference.,tech,tech," the text can be classified as ""tech"" because it discusses internet search engines, a technology-related topic.",output: tech

business,news corp eyes video games market news corp  the media company controlled by australian billionaire rupert murdoch  is eyeing a move into the video games market.  according to the financial times  chief operating officer peter chernin said that news corp is  kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies . santa monica-based activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list. video games are  big business   the paper quoted mr chernin as saying. we  would like to get into it .  the success of products such as sony s playstation  microsoft s x-box and nintendo s game cube have boosted demand for video games. the days of arcade classics such as space invaders  pac-man and donkey kong are long gone. today  games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. and with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies  video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.  mr chernin  however  told the ft that news corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target.  we are struggling with the gap between companies like electronic arts (ea)  which comes with a high price tag  and the next tier of companies   he explained during a conference in phoenix  arizona.  these may be too focused on one or two product lines.  activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (£1.57bn)  compared to ea s $17.8bn. some of the games industry s main players have recently been looking to consolidate their position by making acquisitions. france s ubisoft  one of europe s biggest video game publishers  has been trying to remain independent since electronic arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm. analysts have said that industry mergers are likely in the future.,business,business, business,output: business

tech,blogs take on the mainstream web logs or blogs are everywhere  with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.  these online diaries come in many shapes and styles  ranging from people willing to sharing their views  pictures and links  to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events  often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. most blogs may have only a small readership  but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. the most well-known examples include iraqi salam pax s accounts of the us-led war  former iranian vice-president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic s government  and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign. there are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs  like wikinews.com  launched last november.  the blogging movement has been building up for many years.  andrew nachison  director of the media center  a us-based think-tank that studies media  technology and society  highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs.  you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power  to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before   he says.  and blogs were a key part of that transformation.  among them were blogs carrying picture messages  saying  we are sorry  for george w bush s victory and the responses from his supporters. mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers  tv and radio.  we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases  mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas   he told the bbc news website.  but they followed the story  they didn t lead it.   some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor  raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.  others  like the french newspaper le monde  have applied a different strategy  offering blogs as part of its content.  i don t think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. it is in transition  as society itself is in transition   says mr nachison. however  he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky  that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper.  the one-to-many road of traditional journalism  yes  it is threatened. and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse   says mr nachison.  the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what s acceptable for public consumption and what isn t  that s gone forever.   with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets  like camera or video phones  we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.   it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.  but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing  in a web already overloaded with information. blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence  the so-called blogosphere  has already exceeded five million  and is growing at exponential levels. tools such as google s blogger  movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog. us research think-tank pew internet & american life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds  although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. but experts agree that the phenomenon  allowing individuals to publish  share ideas  exchange information  comment on current issues  post images or video on the web easily  is here to stay.  we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other   said mr nachison.  and there s going to be bad that comes with the good.,entertainment,politics, tech,output: tech

business,yukos seeks court action on sale yukos will return to a us court on wednesday to seek sanctions against baikal finance group  the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.  yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. yukos  us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. baikal s background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.  russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles  £4.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas  russia s fourth-biggest oil producer. many observers believe that the unit  which produces 60% of yukos  oil output  could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom  the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.  the russian government forced the sale of yukos  most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. yukos  us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of us bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. on wednesday  yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group.  we believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us   yukos spokesman mike lake told agence france press.  if it exports that oil  it will be marketing a stolen product   he added. the future ownership of yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that baikal was established as a front for other interests.  speaking on tuesday  president putin said baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other russian energy firms interested in the development of yuganskneftegas. president putin also suggested that china s national petroleum corporation could play a role in the unit s future after signing a commercial agreement with gazprom to work on joint energy projects. yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. commentators and yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder  mikhail khodorkovsky.,business,business, business,output: business

tech,solutions to net security fears fake bank e-mails  or phishing  and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce  say e-business experts.  trust in online security is falling as a result. almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. the survey of more than 1 000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats  said security firm rsa  which carried out the poll. an estimated 12 million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular.   i don t think the threat is overplayed   barry beal  global security manager for capgemini  told the bbc news website. he added:  the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability.  ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too  as well as the individual  and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud  he said.  card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. if we do that  they will indemnify us   he said. many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual s identity. several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords  which are easily compromised and easy to forget. last year  a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate.  on average  people have to remember four different passwords. some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. in a separate survey by rsa  80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. for many  the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions  or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.  activcard is just one of the many companies  like rsa security  which has been trying to come up with just that. rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. activcard s method is more complex. it is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with uk banks. steve ash  from activcard  told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification. the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.   the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both.  the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. it combines that with usual usernames and passwords  as well as other security questions.  you take the card  put it in the reader  enter your pin number  and a code is given.  if you wanted then to transfer funds  for instance  you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction.  the clever bit happens back at the bank s secure servers. the code is validated by the bank s systems  matching the information they expect with the customer s unique key.  each individual gets a key which is unique to them. it is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack   said mr ash. it means that in a typical security attack  explains mr ash  even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites  they need the passcode.  by the time they go back [to use the information]  the code has expired  so they can t prove who they are   according to mr ash. in the next few years  mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use.  pcs will have readers built into them  the cost of readers will be very cheap  and more people will have the cards.  the gadgets we carry around  like personal digital assistants (pdas) and mobiles  could also have integrated card reader technology in them.  the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around   he said.,tech,tech, tech,output: tech
business,s korean lender faces liquidation creditors of south korea s top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.  lg card s creditors have given lg group until wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. the firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in january 2004  which gave control to the creditors. lg group has said any package should reflect the firm s new ownership  and it will not accept an unfair burden. at least seven million people in south korea use lg card s plastic for purchases.  lg card s creditors have threatened parent group lg group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.   creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against lg group if lg card is liquidated   said yoo ji-chang  governor of korean development bank (kdb) - one of the card firm s major creditors. lg group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. it says it wants  fair and reasonable guidelines  on splitting the financial burden with the creditors  who now own 99.3% of lg card. the creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets  kdb said. analysts believe a compromise is likely.  lg group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of lg card   said kim yungmin  an equity strategist at dongwon investment trust management.  lg card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. the firm returned to profit in september 2004  but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the korea stock exchange. the exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. lg card s creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm  which owes about $12.05bn.  eventually  lg group will have to participate  but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions   said mr kim.,business,business, business,output: business

tech,ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic  a small  mountainous state of the former soviet republic  is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.  this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as  an island of democracy   the kyrgyz president  askar akaev  pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.  the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003  reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the german embassy  the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.  the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. the ink is sprayed on a person s left thumb. it dries and is not visible under normal light.  however  the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. at the entrance to each polling station  one election official will scan voter s fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter  and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. likewise  any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics  notably ukraine and georgia. the use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.  widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.  the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful  radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. others  such as the aggressively middle of the road  coalition of non-governmental organizations  have lauded the move as an important step forward. this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world  in countries as varied as serbia  south africa  indonesia and turkey. the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in afghanistan showed  improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. the use of  invisible  ink is not without its own problems. in most elections  numerous rumors have spread about it.  in serbia  for example  both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks  solvents and cleaning products are put forward. however  in reality  the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. the ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. the passage of the inking law is  nevertheless  a clear step forward towards free and fair elections.  the country s widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 february.  david mikosz works for the ifes  an international  non-profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies.,politics,politics, politics,output: politics
business,s korea spending boost to economy south korea will boost state spending next year in an effort to create jobs and kick start its sputtering economy.  it has earmarked 100 trillion won ($96bn) for the first six months of 2005  60% of its total annual budget. the government s main problems are  slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry . it aims to create 400 000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building  as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers.  the government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action.  internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005   the finance and economy ministry said in a statement.  it blamed  continuing uncertainties such as fluctuating oil prices and foreign exchange rates and stagnant domestic demand that has shown few signs of a quick rebound . in 2004  growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%  the ministry said. not everyone is convinced the plan will work.  our primary worry centres on the what we believe is the government s overly optimistic view that its front loading of the budget will be enough to turn the economy around   consultancy 4cast said in a report.  the problem facing south korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst. millions of south koreans are defaulting on their credit card bills  and the country s biggest card lender has been hovering on the verge of bankruptcy for months. as part of its spending plans  the government said it will ask firms to  roll over mortgage loans that come due in the first half of 2005  . it also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes.  the government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade.  given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector  a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects   the ministry said.  as a result  south korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools  hospitals  houses and other public buildings. it also will look at real estate tax system. other plans on the table include promoting new industries such as bio-technology and nano-technology  as well as offering increased support to small and medium sized businesses.  the focus will be on job creation and economic recovery  given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the korean economy in 2005   the ministry said.,business,business, business,output: business
politics,fido  to be taken off vote lists the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote  the uk elections watchdog has said.  those are some of the mistakes found under the current system  where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. voters need to register by 11 march if the next poll is on 5 may as expected. but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election.  the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual  identifiers  when they vote - such as their own voting number  date of birth and signature. the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system. there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll  the mps heard. and some people have registered all their family  regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. non-british citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.  mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register  the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at  hard to reach  voters  for example. some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. mr younger said using the royal mail s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50 000 voters.  he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. he said it might also help register students in halls of residences  where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. the mps on the office of the deputy prime minister and constitutional affairs select committees pressed mr younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. he said the northern ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. currently  british voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. mr younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.,politics,politics," the text should be classified as ""politics"" since it discusses changes to voting registration in the uk and related issues such as fraud, human rights laws, and the role of local councils.",output: politics
politics,no more concessions  on terror charles clarke says he has  no desire  to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.  mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour s majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde  tory leader in the lords  said ministers should expect it to be  substantially re-written .  the bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against.  on monday  mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order  amounting to house arrest  would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should  prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill .  they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals  which are for house arrest.   but mr clarke told bbc radio 4 s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords.  no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made  but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords   he said.   i have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill.  mr clarke s proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps. the debate is unlikely to result in a vote. speaking after the commons debate  shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been  clearly very badly drawn-up  and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. he said it would be possible to  rescue  the government and make the law  tolerable  by amending it in the lords.  the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous   he told bbc news.  mark oaten  for the liberal democrats  said monday night s vote showed the government had  lost the confidence of all sides of the house . he said:  they need to rethink the bill  and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders  build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects.  unless there is a major movement  this bill is doomed to fail.   bbc news political editor andrew marr said:  i think that this is a bill in deep trouble. it s been unravelling in the house of commons - it may unravel further.  the government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 march  when the current powers expire.,politics,politics, politics,output: politics

business,fosters buys stake in winemaker australian brewer fosters has bought a large stake in australian winemaker southcorp  sparking rumours of a possible takeover.  fosters bought 18.8% of southcorp  the global winemaker behind the penfolds  lindemans and rosemount brands  for 4.17 australian dollars per share. a bid at that price would value the company at a$3.1bn ($2.4bn; £1.25bn ). fosters said it was currently in discussions  which may lead to a major corporate announcement .  in a separate statement  southcorp confirmed the brewer had asked for talks. both firms asked the sydney stock market to suspend trading in their shares until monday. southcorp s shares were suspended at a$4.25.  fosters bought the 18.8% stake from reline investments  the family investment firm for the oatleys  who founded the rosemount estates label and sold it to southcorp in 2001. robert oatley and his son sandy oatley have both resigned from southcorp s board following the share deal. southcorp employs 2 700 people and is the largest single investor in rural australia  according to its website. the prospect of fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors  as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. it has cash available  after getting a$846m from selling property business lensworth  but it has been widely expected to return cash to shareholders.   people will scratching their heads over this one. fosters has done a back-flip   said shawn burns  a fund manger at deutsche asset management. southcorp s shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target. it spent two years in the red  returning to profit in 2004. consolidation in the wine industry is being driven by constellation  the world s biggest winemaker. it seized the top spot when it bought australian firm brl hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. since then  it has paid $1bn for us wine maker robert mondavi  bought last month. fosters  main wine business is beringer blass wine estate. its best known brand is fosters lager  though it makes a clutch of beer brands  and spirits. analysts were divided on thursday about whether fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival.  currently  i think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover   said one analyst quoted by the agence france presse news agency. however  matt williams  a fund manager at perpetual trustees said taking the stake  is definitely a precursor to a takeover .,business,business, business,output: business
tech,smartphones suffer skulls attack owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper.  those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. when installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610 s functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones.  the file  nicknamed skulls  is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons  such as wallpaper  games and ringtones  for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. the skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip.  once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications  such as contacts  calendar  notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it  one of which includes ignoring a security warning. symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. despite this finnish anti-virus lab f-secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee-222. symbian phones produced by sony ericsson  motorola  benq  arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program.,tech,tech, tech,output: tech
tech,the force is strong in battlefront the warm reception that has greeted star wars: battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay  but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient.  geared towards online gamers  it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights  set in an array of locations all featured in  or hinted at during  the two blockbusting film trilogies. previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise s extensive universe  and their use of weird and wonderful new characters. battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves.  the sights  sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans  who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars  most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for. the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective  and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side  depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player s personal propensity for good or evil.  there is ample chance to be a wookie  shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired-up luke skywalker. in each section  the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops  seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. it really is no more complicated than that. locations include the frozen wastes of hoth  the ice planet from the empire strikes back  complete with massive mechanical at-ats on the march. there are also the dusty  sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis  as well as the forest moon of endor  where return of the jedi s much-maligned ewoks lived. the feel of those places is well and truly captured  with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic. it is worth noting though that on the playstation 2  the game s graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version. the pivotal element behind battlefront s success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war. the number of combatants  noise and abundance of laser fire see to that  and the sense of chaos really comes over.  speaking of noise  battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy s audio motifs.  the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar  as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up. there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section. it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars  it would not stand up for long. the gameplay is reliable  bog-standard stuff  short on originality. there are also odd annoyances  like the game s insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action  an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear. and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be. that said  it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike  however non user-friendly they prove. whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind  battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game. the above-average ai of the enemy sees to that  although given the frenetic environments they operate in  their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated. battlefront s novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast  leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game. but for a while  it is an absolute blast  and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas  stable.,entertainment,entertainment," sport, tech, business, entertainment, or politics.: entertainment",output: entertainment
business,india s deccan seals $1.8bn deal air deccan has ordered 30 airbus a320 planes in a $1.8bn (£931m) deal as india s first low-cost airline expands in the fast-growing domestic market.  air deccan was set up last year and wants to lure travellers away from the railway network and pricier rivals. the potential of the indian market has attracted attention at home and abroad. beer magnate vijay mallya recently set up kingfisher airlines  while uk entrepreneur richard branson has said he is keen to start a local operation.  the country has a population of more than a billion people and many observers feel that it is underserved by airlines. recently however  the booming economy has boosted personal spending power and helped swell the middle classes and the corporate sector. india s government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel.  the days of flying being a symbol of only maharajas or the rich are over   the minister for civil aviation praful patel said earlier. infrastructure is being built to handle the expected increase in demand and on tuesday  agence france presse reported that a group led by germany s siemens won the contract to build a private airport near bangalore. india s airports authority and the state government will own 13% each of the finished transport hub. for its part  air deccan  set up by army officer and silk farmer gorur gopinath  plans to increase its fleet to 60 aircraft within five years. to help finance the expansion the company may sell a 25% stake to an investor for about $50m. when it was set up the firm offered tickets that were 50% cheaper than other indian airlines. it said it was basing its business model on european firms such as ireland s ryanair.,business,business, business,output: business
politics,blair blasts tory spending plans tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans  saying they are a  ludicrous improbability .  the prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure. tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut £35bn in  wasteful  spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. on saturday  tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing  inefficiencies  which had  burgeoned  under labour. in his speech  mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party  which had learned to occupy the political centre ground  with a hidebound tory party  which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. mr blair said:  the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk  both britain s hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages  inflation  unemployment  for decades - and the key investment in public services.   i believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it s possible to imagine   he said.  it s a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of conservative government.  mr blair added:  they  the conservatives have learned nothing.  by contrast  he said  new labour had listened to its electorate and changed.  mr blair went on to list his government s achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party.  so now we have a choice  we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. and i say we have to fight.  in response  david davis said the tories would make cuts  such as removing regional assemblies  but would bring in more police officers and match labour s spending on health and education.  everybody knows  having lived through this government the last seven years  that they faced lots of stealth tactics  lots of increases in taxes  but no improvement in public services   he said. mr davis said labour had been responsible for  huge waste  huge overspending  not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy .  the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government  less waste and lower taxes with a tory government   he concluded.  gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. the chancellor said the conservatives  plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011  which the tories deny. mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be  distracted or diverted . according to an advance text released by officials  he told delegates:  we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.   mr brown warned that the tories were planning  the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto . meanwhile  tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of  misrepresenting  the party s proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans.  he still cannot accept the simple truth  which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools  hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes   mr letwin said.  once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans,politics,politics, politics,output: politics

tech,podcasters  look to net money nasa is doing it  14-year-old boys in bedrooms are doing it  couples are doing it  gadget lovers - male and female - are definitely doing it.  it is podcasting - diy radio in the form of downloadable mp3 audio files. they can done by anyone who has a microphone  simple software  the net  and something to say. some liken them to talking  audioblogs  because many complement text-based weblogs - diary-like sites where people share their thoughts. they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net  on demand  and the  movement  is at very early stages.  it s about real people saying real things and communicating   says adam curry  former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting. he was one of a community of people who created ipodder  a small computer program  known as an  aggregator .  it collects and automatically sends mp3 files to any digital music-playing device that can play wmp formats. those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like  and subscribe - for free - to that show s  feed . when a new podcast is available  it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer.  it is totally going to kill the business model of radio   thinks curry.  i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are   he says.  and they are scared to death of the next generation - like my daughter who is 14 - who don t listen to radio.  they are on msn  they ve got their ipod  their mp3 player  they ve got their xbox - they are not listening to radio.  so how are they going to reach these audiences   it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it.   it is a fledgling movement  but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it. ian fogg  jupiter research analyst  thinks there could be potential for business  but it could take an interesting turn if big companies  like apple and microsoft  get involved.  it is a nascent area but quite exciting. it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over   he says.   podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about - a classic hybrid. it is another aspect of the  time-shifting  of content - the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want  when  and wherever you want. audiences are in the 10s  100s  and 1 000s rather than millions. more than 4 300 podcasts are currently listed. curry s daily source code - which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community - has 10s of thousands of listeners.  but dave winer is doubtful. he designed the format called rss (really simple syndication)  which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like. podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed. he is also writer of the longest-running weblog on the net  scripting news. he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential  not in its  over-hyped  business promise.   we re the sources  the people doing stuff  and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we re doing.  no matter how you look at it  commercialising this medium isn t going to make very much money   he says.  podcasting is going to be a medium of niches  with  audiences  measured in the single digits  like e-mail or blogs.  maybe in a few years  maybe six or seven digits. but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon.  curry and associate ron bloom s new venture  called podshow  is to help ordinary people produce  post  distribute and market their podcasts. because of the way podcasts work  based on rss  the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets.  when you look at podcasting - wow this is a pretty interesting audience. the audience is pre-selected. they have decided to subscribe to your program   explains curry. advertising  in his eyes  can be tailored to podcasts  to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive.  how i believe this will work  is to create a network that  in aggregation  will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters.  i have 50  60  70 000 listeners. i could make a couple of bucks off that  but not much. if you are talking a million podcasters  and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves  then that is kind of interesting.  essentially  he says  if you are doing a bass fishing podcast  someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show. he is clear the ads will not be the traditional  in-your-face  type familiar to commercial radio now.  we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place.   it is happening already. coffee-loving curry has sold $4 000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site.  others use in-show promotions  like the dawn and drew show. one  eric rice  has won sponsorship from warner bros. he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push. some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days. others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative. one thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry. the creative forces behind radio are elated  says curry. for now  he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community.  i should be knighted for this   he adds  with a wry chuckle   people are going to be so happy to sit at home  make their podcast  and make a little money.,entertainment,tech, tech,output: tech
